# Touch_Grid

Touch_Grid is an interactive web-based project that combines dynamic visual effects with audio synthesis. Users can engage with a responsive checkerboard grid that distorts and highlights based on mouse or touch interactions. The project also integrates real-time sound feedback using Tone.js, making it an engaging exploration of creative coding and user interactivity.
